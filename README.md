 Fliostarter -Token Sale Launchpad
 
fliostarter platform allows cryptocurrency projects to raise funds by setting up a swap pool based on a fixed purchase rate for tokens. These so called “Fixed Swap Pools” have many advantages for token sale investors over traditional fundraising models like ICOs, IEOs and IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings). Fixed Swap Pools will maintain the token price throughout the sale until the initial supply is bought.
